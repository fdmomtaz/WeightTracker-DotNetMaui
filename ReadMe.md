# .NET MAUI Weight Tracker App

**Work in progress**

Welcome to the .NET MAUI Weight Tracker App, an open-source project showcasing the power and elegance of .NET MAUI for building good looking cross-platform applications. My goal is to demonstrate that you can build a fully functional and visually appealing app using .NET MAUI, backed by a SQLite local database for robust data management.

**Images coming soon**

## Features

- **Current Weight and Progress Display:** A beautifully designed homepage that not only shows your current weight but also visualizes your progress over time.
- **Weight History:** Dive into your weight history with a dedicated page that outlines your journey, helping you stay motivated and informed.
- **Local Data Storage:** Utilizes a SQLite database to store and retrieve your weight data securely and efficiently, ensuring your data remains private and accessible across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- .NET MAUI: The latest framework for building cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows with a single codebase.
- SQLite: A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
- NET MAUI Community Toolkit: A collection of reusable elements for mobile and desktop development with .NET MAUI, including converters, behaviors, and effects to speed up development and enhance app capabilities.
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm: An MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) toolkit that simplifies the implementation of the MVVM pattern in .NET applications, providing advanced features like observable properties, commands, and messaging that make developing responsive, testable apps easier.
- MVVM Architecture: Leveraging the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to promote a clean separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have the .NET 8 SDK and with the .NET MAUI workload.
