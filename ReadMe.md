# .NET MAUI Weight Tracker App

![App Icon](Pictures/AppIcon.png "App Icon")

Welcome to the .NET MAUI Weight Tracker App, an open-source project showcasing the power and elegance of .NET MAUI for building good looking cross-platform applications. My goal is to demonstrate that you can build a fully functional and visually appealing app using .NET MAUI, backed by a SQLite local database for robust data management.

## Features

- **Current Weight and Progress Display:** A beautifully designed homepage that not only shows your current weight but also visualizes your progress over time.
- **Weight History:** Dive into your weight history with a dedicated page that outlines your journey, helping you stay motivated and informed.
- **Local Data Storage:** Utilizes a SQLite database to store and retrieve your weight data securely and efficiently, ensuring your data remains private and accessible across sessions.
